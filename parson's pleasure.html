        MR BOGGIS was driving the car slowly, leaning back comfortably in the sea
        t with one elbow resting or the sill of the open window. How beautifu the
         countryside, he thought; how pleasant to see a sign or two of summer onc
        e again. The primroses especially. And the hawthorn .71e hawthorn was exp
        loding white and pink and red along the hedges and the primroses were gro
        wing underneath in little clumps, and it was beautiful.<br><br>
         He took one hand off the wheel and lii himself a cigarette. The best thin
        g now, he told himself, would be to make for the top of Brill Hill. He could
        see it about half 2 mile ahead. And that must be the village 01 Brill, that c
        luster of cottages among the tree right on the very summit. Excellent. Not ma
        ns of his Sunday sections had a nice elevation like that to work from.
         He drove up the bill and stopped the car jusi short of the summit on the
         outskirts of the village. Then he got out and looked around. Down below, th
        e countryside was spread out before him like a huge green carpet. He could s
        ee for miles. It was perfect. He took a pad and pencil from his pocket, lean
        ed against the back of the car, and allowed his practised eye to travel slow
        ly over the landscape.<br><br>
         He could see one medium farmhouse over on the right, back in the fields,
         with a track leading to it from the road. There was another larger one beyo
        nd it. There was a house surrounded by tall elms that looked as though it mi
        ght be a Queen Anne, and there were two likely farms away over on the left.
        Five places in all. That was about the lot in this direction.
         Mr Boggis drew a rough sketch on his pad showing the position of each s
        o that he'd be able to find them easily when he was down below, then he got
         back into the car and drove up through the village to the other side of th
        e hill. From there he spotted six more possibles--five farms and one big wh
        ite Georgian house. He studied the Georgian house through his binoculars. I
        t had a clean prosperous look, and the garden was well ordered. That was a
        pity. He ruled it out immediately. There was no point in calling on the pro
        sperous.<br><br>
         In this square then, in this section, there were ten possibles in all.
        Ten was a nice number, Mr Boggis told himself. Just the right amount for a
        leisurely afternoon's work. What time was it now? Twelve o'clock. He would
        have liked a pint of beer in the pub before he started, but on Sundays they
         didn't open until one. Very well, he would have it later. He glanced at th
        e notes on his pad. He decided to take the Queen Anne first, the house with
         the elms. It had looked nicely dilapidated through the binoculars. The peo
        ple there could probably d? with some money. He was always lucky With Queen
         Annes, anyway. Mr Boggis climbed back into the car, released the handbrake
        , and began cruising slowly down the hill without the engine.<br><br>
         Apart from the fact that he was at this moment disguised in the uniform
         of a clergyman, there was nothing very sinister about Mr Cyril Boggis. By
        trade he was a dealer in antique furniture, with his own shop and showroom
        in the King's Road, Chelsea. His premises were not large, and generally he
        didn't do a great deal of business, but because he always bought cheap, ver
        y very cheap, and sold very very dear, he managed to make quite a tidy litt
        le income every year. He was a talented salesman, and when buying or sellin
        g a piece he could slide smoothly into whichever mood suited the client bes
        t. He could become grave and charming for the aged, obsequious for the rich
        ) sober for the godly, masterful for the weak, mischievous for the widow, a
        rch and saucy for the spinster. He was well aware of his gift, using it sha
        melessly on every possible occasion; and often, at the end of an unusually
        good performance, it was as much as he could do to prevent himself from tur
        ning aside and taking a bow or two as the thundering applause of the audien
        ce went rolling through the theatre.<br><br>
         In spite of this rather clownish quality of his, Mr Boggis was not a fo
        ol. In fact, it was said of him by some that he probably knew as much about
         French, English, and Italian furniture as anyone else in London. He also h
        ad surprisingly good taste, and he was quick to recognize and reject an ung
        raceful design, however genuine the article might be. His real love, natura
        lly, was for the work of the great eighteenth-century English designers, In
        ce, Mayhew, Chippendale, Robert Adam, Manwaring, Inigo Jones, Hepplewhite,
        Kent, Johnson, George Smith, Lock, Sheraton, and the rest of them, but even
         with these he occasionally drew the line. He refused, for example, to allo
        w a single piece from Chippendale's Chinese or Gothic period to come into h
        is showroom, and the same was true of some of the heavier Italian designs o
        f Robert Adam.<br><br>
         During the past few years, Mr Boggis had achieved considerable fame amo
        ng his friends in the trade by his ability to produce unusual and often qui
        te rare items with astonishing regularity. Apparently the man had a source
        of supply that was almost inexhaustible, a sort of private warehouse, and i
        t seemed that all he had to do was to drive out to it once a week and help
        himself. Whenever they asked him where he got the stuff, he would smile kno
        wingly and wink and murmur something about a little secret.<br><br>
         The idea behind Mr Boggis's little secret was a simple one, and it had c
        ome to him as a result of something that had happened on a certain Sunday af
        ternoon nearly nine years before, while he was driving in the country.
        He had gone out in the morning to visit his old mother, who lived in Se
venoaks, and on the way back the fanbelt on his car had broken, causing the
 engine to overheat and the water to boil away. He had got out of the car a
nd walked to the nearest house, a smallish farm building about fifty yards
off the road, and had asked the woman who answered the door if he could ple
ase have a jug of water.<br><br>
 While he was waiting for her to fetch it, he happened to glance in throu
gh the door to the livingroom, and there, not five yards from where he was s
tanding, he spotted something that made him so excited the sweat began to co
me out all over the top of his head. It was a large oak armchair of a type t
hat he had only seen once before in his life. Each arm, as well as the panel
 at the back, was supported by a row of eight beautifully turned spindles. T
he back panel itself was decorated by an inlay of the most delicate floral d
esign, and the head of a duck was carved to lie along half the length of eit
her arm. Good God, he thought. This thing is late fifteenth century!
 He poked his head in further through the door, and there, by heavens, was
 another of them on the other side of the fireplace!
 He couldn't be sure, but two chairs like that must be worth at least a t
housand pounds up in London. And oh, what beauties they were!
 When the woman returned, Mr Boggis introduced himself and straight away
 asked if she would like to sell her chairs.<br><br>
 Dear me, she said. But why on earth should she want to sell her chairs?
 No reason at all, except that he might be willing to give her a pretty nice p
rice.<br><br>
 And how much would he give? They were definitely not for sale, but just
 out of curiosity, just for fun, you know, how much would he give?
 Thirty-five pounds.
 How much?
 Thirty-five pounds.
 Dear me, thirty-five pounds. Well, well, that was very interesting. She
'd always thought they were valuable. They were very old. They were very co
mfortable too. She couldn't possibly do without them, not possibly. No, the
y were not for sale but thank you very much all the same.
 They weren't really so very old, Mr Boggis told her, and they wouldn't be
 at all easy to sell, but it just happened that he had a client who rather li
ked that sort of thing. Maybe he could go up another two pounds--call it thir
ty-seven. How about that?<br><br>
 They bargained for half an hour, and of course in the end Mr Boggis got t
he chairs and agreed to pay her something less than a twentieth of their valu
e.
 That evening, driving back to London in his old station-wagon with the
 two fabulous chairs tucked away snugly in the back, Mr Boggis had suddenl
y been struck by what seemed to him to be a most remarkable idea.
 Look here, he said. If there is good stuff in one farmhouse, then why no
t in others? Why shouldn't he search for it? Why shouldn't he comb the count
ryside? He could do it on Sundays. In that way, it wouldn't interfere with h
is work at all. He never knew what to do with his Sundays.<br><br>
 So Mr Boggis bought maps, large scale maps of all the counties around L
ondon, and with a fine pen he divided each of them up into a series of squa
res. Each of these squares covered an actual area of five miles by five, wh
ich was about as much territory, he estimated, as he could cope with on a s
ingle Sunday, were he to comb it thoroughly. He didn't want the towns and t
he villages.<br><br> It was the comparatively isolated places, the large farmhouses
 and the rather dilapidated country mansions, that he was looking for; and
in this way, if he did one square each Sunday, fifty-two squares a year, he
 would gradually cover every farm and every country house in the home counties.
 But obviously there was a bit more to it than that. Country folk are a s
uspicious lot. So are the impoverished rich. You can't go about ringing thei
r bells and expecting them to show you around their houses just for the aski
ng, because they won't do it. That way you would never get beyond the front
door. How then was he to gain admittance? Perhaps it would be best if he did
n't let them know he was a dealer at all. He could be the telephone man, the
 plumber, the gas inspector. He could even be a clergyman.<br><br>
 From this point on, the whole scheme began to take on a more practi
cal aspect. Mr Boggis ordered a large quantity of superior cards on whi
ch the following legend was engraved: THE REVEREND CYRIL WINNINGTON BOG
GIS President of the Society In association with for the Preservation o
f The Victoria and Rare Furniture Albert Museum.<br><br>
 From now on, every Sunday, he was going to be a nice old parson spendin
g his holiday travelling around on a labour of love for the "Society', comp
iling an inventory of the treasures that lay hidden in the country homes of
 England. And who in the world was going to kick him out when they heard th
at one?<br><br>
 Nobody.
 And then, once he was inside, if he happened to spot something he really
 wanted, well he knew a hundred different ways of dealing with that.
 Rather to Mr Boggis's surprise, the scheme worked. In fact, the friendli
ness with which he was received in one house after another through the count
ryside was, in the beginning, quite embarrassing, even to him. A slice of co
ld pie, a glass of port, a cup of tea, a basket of plums, even a full sit-do
wn Sunday dinner with the family, such things were constantly being pressed
upon him. Sooner or later, of course, there had been some bad moments and a
number of unpleasant incidents, but then nine years is more than four hundre
d Sundays, and that adds up to a great quantity of houses visited. All in al
l, it had been an interesting, exciting, and lucrative business.<br><br>
 And now it was another Sunday and Mr Boggis was operating in the countr
y of Buckinghamshire, in one of the most northerly squares on his map, abou
t ten miles from Oxford, and as he drove down the hill and headed for his f
irst house, the dilapidated Queen Anne, he began to get the feeling that th
is was going to be one of his lucky days.<br><br>
 He parked the car about a hundred yards from the gates and got out to w
alk the rest of the way. He never liked people to see his car until after a
 deal was completed. A dear old clergyman and a large station-wagon somehow
 never seemed quite right together. Also the short walk gave him time to ex
amine the property closely from the outside and to assume the mood most lik
ely to be suitable for the occasion.<br><br>
 Mr Boggis strode briskly up the drive. He was a small fat-legged man wit
h a belly. The face was round and rosy, quite perfect for the pan, and the t
wo large brown eyes that bulged out at you from this rosy face gave an impre
ssion of gentle imbecility. He was dressed in a black suit with the usual pa
rson's dog-collar round his neck, and on his head a soft black hat. He carri
ed an old oak walking-stick which lent him, in his opinion, a rather rustic
easy-going air.<br><br>
 He approached the front door and rang the bell. He heard the sound of f
ootsteps in the hall and the door opened and suddenly there stood before hi
m, or rather above him, a gigantic woman dressed in riding-breeches. Even t
hrough the smoke of her cigarette he could smell the powerful odour of stab
les and horse manure that clung about her.<br><br>
 "Yes?" she asked, looking at him suspiciously. "What is it you want?"
 Mr Boggis, who half expected her to whinny any moment, raised his hat,
made a little bow, and handed her his card. "I do apologize for bothering y
ou," he said, and then he waited, watching her face as she read the message.
 "I don't understand," she said, handing back the card. "What is it you wan
t?"<br><br>
 Mr Boggis explained about the Society for the Preservation of Rare Furnit
ure.
 "This wouldn't by any chance be something to do with the Socialist Party
?" she asked, staring at him fiercely from under a pair of pale bushy brows.
 From then on, it was easy. A Tory in ridingbreeches, male or female, wa
s always a sitting duck for Mr Boggis. He spent two minutes delivering an i
mpassioned eulogy on the extreme Right Wing of the Conservative Party, then
 two more denouncing the Socialists. As a clincher, he made particular refe
rence to the Bill that the Socialists had once introduced for the abolition
 of bloodsports in the country, and went on to inform his listener that his
 idea of heaven--"though you better not tell the bishop, my dear"--was a pl
ace where one could hunt the fox, the stag, and the hare with large packs o
f tireless hounds from morn till night every day of the week, including Sundays.
 Watching her as he spoke, he could see the magic beginning to do its wo
rk. The woman was grinning now, showing Mr Boggis a set of enormous, slight
ly yellow teeth. "Madam," he cried, "I beg of you, please don't get me star
ted on Socialism." At that point, she let out a great guffaw of laughter, r
aised an enormous red hand, and slapped him so hard on the shoulder that he
 nearly went over.<br><br>
 "Come in!" she shouted. "I don't know what the hell you want, but come o
n in!"
 Unfortunately, and rather surprisingly, there was nothing of any value i
n the whole house, and Mr Boggis, who never wasted time on barren territory,
 soon made his excuses and took his leave. The whole visit had taken less th
an fifteen minutes, and that, he told himself as he climbed back into his ca
r and started off for the next place, was exactly as it should be.
 From now on, it was all farmhouses, and the nearest was about half a mil
e up the road. It was a large half-timbered brick building of considerable a
ge, and there was a magnificent pear tree still in blossom covering almost t
he whole of the south wall.<br><br>
 Mr Boggis knocked on the door. He waited, but no one came. He knocked a
gain, but still there was no answer, so he wandered around the back to look
 for the farmer among the cowsheds. There was no one there either. He guess
ed that they must all still be in church, so he began peering in the window
s to see if he could spot anything interesting. There was nothing in the di
ning-room. Nothing in the library either. He tried the next window, the liv
ing-room, and there, right under his nose, in the little alcove that the wi
ndow made, he saw a beautiful thing, a semicircular card-table in mahogany,
 richly veneered, and in the style of Hepplewhite, built around 1780.
 "Ah-ha," he said aloud, pressing his face hard against the glass. "Well do
ne, Boggis."<br><br>
 But that was not all. There was a chair there as well, a single chair, an
d if he were not mistaken it was of an even finer quality than the table. Ano
ther Hepplewhite, wasn't it? And oh, what a beauty! The lattices on the back
were finely carved with the honeysuckle, the husk, and the paterae, the canin
g on the seat was original, the legs were very gracefully turned and the two
back ones had that peculiar outward splay that meant so much. It was an exqui
site chair. "Before this day is done," Mr Boggis said softly, "I shall have t
he pleasure of sitting down upon that lovely seat." He never bought a chair w
ithout doing this. It was a favourite test of his, and it was always an intri
guing sight to see him lowering himself delicately into the seat, waiting for
 the "give', expertly gauging the precise but infinitesimal degree of shrinka
ge that the years had caused in the mortice and dovetail joints.
 But there was no hurry, he told himself. He would return here later. He
had the whole afternoon before him.<br><br>
 The next farm was situated some way back in the fields, and in order to k
eep his car out of sight, Mr Boggis had to leave it on the road and walk abou
t six hundred yards along a straight track that led directly into the back ya
rd of the farmhouse. This place, he noticed as he approached, was a good deal
 smaller than the last, and he didn't hold out much hope for it. It looked ra
mbling and dirty, and some of the sheds were clearly in bad repair.
 There were three men standing in a close group in a corner of the yard,
 and one of them had two large black greyhounds with him, on leashes. When
the men caught sight of Mr Boggis walking forward in his black suit and par
son's collar, they stopped talking and seemed suddenly to stiffen and freez
e, becoming absolutely still, motionless, three faces turned towards him, w
atching him suspiciously as he approached.<br><br>
 The oldest of the three was a stumpy man with a wide frog-mouth and s
mall shifty eyes, and although Mr Boggis didn't know it, his name was Rum
mins and he was the owner of the farm.
 The tall youth beside him, who appeared to have something wrong with
one eye, was Bert, the son of Rummins.
 The shortish flat-faced man with a narrow corrugated brow and immensely
 broad shoulders was Claud. Claud had dropped in on Rummins in the hope of
getting a piece of pork or ham out of him from the pig that had been killed
 the day before. Claud knew about the killing--the noise of it had carried
far across the fields--and he also knew that a man should have a government
 permit to do that sort of thing, and that Rummins didn't have one.
 "Good afternoon," Mr Boggis said. "Isn't it a lovely day?"
 None of the three men moved. At that moment they were all thinking prec
isely the same thing that somehow or other this clergyman, who was certainl
y not the local fellow, had been sent to poke his nose into their business
and to report what he found to the government.<br><br>
 "What beautiful dogs," Mr Boggis said. "I must say I've never been greyho
und-racing myself, but they tell me it's a fascinating sport."
 Again the silence, and Mr Boggis glanced quickly from Rummins to Bert,
 then to Claud, then back again to Rummins, and he noticed that each of th
em had the same peculiar expression on his face, something between a jeer
and a challenge, with a contemptuous curl to the mouth and a sneer around
the nose.<br><br>
 "Might I inquire if you are the owner?" Mr Boggis asked, undaunted, ad
dressing himself to Rummins.
 "What is it you want?"
 "I do apologize for troubling you, especially on a Sunday."
 Mr Boggis offered his card and Rummins took it and held it up close to hi
s face. The other two didn't move, but their eyes swivelled over to one side,
 trying to see.
 "And what exactly might you be wanting?" Rummins asked.
 For the second time that morning, Mr Boggis explained at some length the
 aims and ideals of the Society for the Preservation of Rare Furniture.
 "We don't have any," Rummins told him when it was over. "You're wasti
ng your time."<br><br>
 "Now, just a minute, sir," Mr Boggis said, raising a finger. "The last
man who said that to me was an old farmer down in Sussex, and when he final
ly let me into his house, d'you know what I found? A dirty-looking old chai
r in the corner of the kitchen, and it turned out to be worth four hundred
pounds! I showed him how to sell it, and he bought himself a new tractor wi
th the money."
 "What on earth are you talking about?" Claud said. "There ain't no chair
 in the world worth four hundred pound."
 "Excuse me," Mr Boggis answered primly, "but there are plenty of chairs
 in England worth more than twice that figure. And you know where they are?
 They're tucked away in the farms and cottages all over the country, with t
he owners using them as steps and ladders and standing on them with hobnail
ed boots to reach a pot of jam out of the top cupboard or to hang a picture
. This is the truth I'm telling you, my friends."<br><br>
 Rummins shifted uneasily on his feet. "You mean to say all you want to
do is go inside and stand there in the middle of the room and look around?"
 "Exactly," Mr Boggis said. He was at last beginning to sense what the tro
uble might be. "I don't want to pry into your cupboards or into your larder.
I just want to look at the furniture to see if you happen to have any treasur
es here, and then I can write about them in our Society magazine."
 "You know what I think?" Rummins said, fixing him with his small wicked
 eyes. "I think you're after buying the sniff yourself. Why else would you
be going to all this trouble?"<br><br>
 "Oh, dear me. I only wish I had the money. Of course, if I saw something
 that I took a great fancy to, and it wasn't beyond my means, 1 might be tem
pted to make an offer. But alas, that rarely happens."
 "Well," Rummins said, "I don't suppose there's any harm in your taking
a look around if that's all you want." He led the way across the yard to th
e back door of the farmhouse, and Mr Boggis followed him; so did the son Be
rt, and Claud with his two dogs. They went through the kitchen, where the o
nly furniture was a cheap deal table with a dead chicken lying on it, and t
hey emerged into a fairly large, exceedingly filthy living-room.<br><br>
 And there it was! Mr Boggis saw it at once, and he stopped dead in his tra
cks and gave a little shrill gasp of shock. Then he stood there for five, ten,
 fifteen seconds at least, staring like an idiot, unable to believe, not darin
g to believe what he saw before him. It couldn't be true, not possibly! But th
e longer he stared, the more true it began to seem. After all, there it was st
anding against the wall right in front of him, as real and as solid as the hou
se itself. And who in the world could possibly make a mistake about a thing li
ke that? Admittedly it was painted white, but that made not the slightest diff
erence. Some idiot had done that. The paint could easily be stripped off. But
good God! Just look at it! And in a place like this!<br><br>
 At this point, Mr Boggis became aware of the three men, Rummins, Bert,
and Claud, standing together in a group over by the fireplace, watching him
 intently. They had seen him stop and gasp and stare, and they must have se
en his face turning red, or maybe it was white, but in any event they had s
een enough to spoil the whole goddamn business if he didn't do something ab
out it quick. In a flash, Mr Boggis clapped one hand over his heart, stagge
red to the nearest chair, and collapsed into it, breathing heavily.
 "What's the matter with you?" Claud asked.
 "It's nothing," he gasped. "I'll be all right in a minute. Please--a glass of w
ater. It's my heart."<br><br>
 Bert fetched him the water, handed it to him, and stayed close beside him
, staring down at him with a fatuous leer on his face.
 "I thought maybe you were looking at something," Rummins said. The wide
 frogmouth widened a fraction further into a crafty grin, showing the stubs
 of several broken teeth.
 "No, no," Mr Boggis said. "Oh dear me, no. It's just my heart. I'm so sorr
y. It happens every now and then. But it goes away quite quickly. I'll be all
right in a couple of minutes."<br><br>
 He must have time to think, he told himself. More important still, he mu
st have time to compose himself thoroughly before he said another word. Take
 it gently, Boggis. And whatever you do, keep calm. These people may be igno
rant, but they are not stupid. They are suspicious and wary and sly. And if
it is really true--no it can't be, it can't be true.
 He was holding one hand up over his eyes in a gesture of pain, and now,
very carefully, secretly, he made a little crack between two of the fingers
and peeked through.<br><br>
 Sure enough, the thing was still there, and on this occasion he took a good
 long look at it. Yes--he had been right the first time! There wasn't the sligh
test doubt about it! It was really unbelievable!
 What he saw was a piece of furniture that any expert would have given
almost anything to acquire. To a layman, it might not have appeared partic
ularly impressive, especially when covered over as it was with dirty white
 paint, but to Mr Boggis it was a dealer's dream. He knew, as does every o
ther dealer in Europe and America, that among the most celebrated and cove
ted examples of eighteenth-century English furniture in existence are the
three famous pieces known as "The Chippendale Commodes'. He knew their his
tory backwards that the first was "discovered' in 1920, in a house at More
ton-inMarsh, and was sold at Sotheby's the same year; that the other two t
urned up in the same auction rooms a year later, both coming out of Raynha
m Hall, Norfolk. They all fetched enormous prices. He couldn't quite remem
ber the exact figure for the first one, or even the second, but he knew fo
r certain that the last one to be sold had fetched thirty-nine hundred gui
neas. And that was in 1921! Today the same piece would surely be worth ten
 thousand pounds.<br><br> Some man, Mr Boggis couldn't remember his name, had made
 a study of these commodes fairly recently and had proved that all three m
ust have come from the same workshop, for the veneers were all from the sa
me log, and the same set of templates had been used in the construction of
 each. No invoices had been found for any of them, but all the experts wer
e agreed that these three commodes could have been executed only by Thomas
 Chippendale himself, with his own hands, at the most exalted period in his career.
 And here, Mr Boggis kept telling himself as he peered cautiously thr
ough the crack in his fingers, here was the fourth Chippendale Commode!
And he had found it! He would be rich! He would also be famous! Each of
the other three was known throughout the furniture world by a special na
me--The Chastleton Commode, The First Raynham Commode, The Second Raynha
m Commode.<br><br> This one would go down in history as The Boggis Commode! Just
 imagine the faces of the boys up there in London when they got a look a
t it tomorrow morning! And the luscious offers coming in from the big fe
llows over in the West End--Frank Partridge, Mallet, Jetley, and the res
t of them! There would be a picture of it in The Times, and it would say
, "The very fine Chippendale Commode which was recently discovered by Mr
 Cyril Boggis, a London dealer.... " Dear God, what a stir he was going to make!
 This one here, Mr Boggis thought, was almost exactly similar to the Sec
ond Raynham Commode. (All three, the Chastleton and the two Raynhams, diffe
red from one another in a number of small ways.) It was a most impressive h
andsome affair, built in the French rococo style of Chippendale's Directoir
e period, a kind of large fat chest-of-drawers set upon four carved and flu
ted legs that raised it about a foot from the ground.<br><br> There were six drawer
s in all, two long ones in the middle and two shorter ones on either side.
The serpentine front was magnificently ornamented along the top and sides a
nd bottom, and also vertically between each set of drawers, with intricate
carvings of festoons and scrolls and clusters. The brass handles, although
partly obscured by white paint, appeared to be superb. It was, of course, a
 rather "heavy' piece, but the design had been executed with such elegance
and grace that the heaviness was in no way offensive.<br><br>
 "How're you feeling now?" Mr Boggis heard someone saying.
 "Thank you, thank you, I'm much better already. It passes quickly. My doct
or says it's nothing to worry about really so long as I rest for a few minutes
 whenever it happens. Ah yes," he said, raising himself slowly to his feet. "T
hat's better. I'm all right now."
 A trifle unsteadily, he began to move around the room examining the furn
iture, one piece at a time, commenting upon it briefly. He could see at once
 that apart from the commode it was a very poor lot.<br><br>
 "Nice oak table," he said. "But I'm afraid it's not old enough to be of
any interest. Good comfortable chairs, but quite modern, yes, quite modern.
Now this cupboard, well, it's rather attractive, but again, not valuable. Th
is chest-of-drawers"--he walked casually past the Chippendale Commode and ga
ve it a little contemptuous flip with his fingers--"worth a few pounds, I da
re say, but no more. A rather crude reproduction, I'm afraid. Probably made
in Victorian times. Did you paint it white?"
 "Yes," Runimins said, "Bert did it."<br><br>
 "A very wise move. It's considerably less offensive in white."
 "That's a strong piece of furniture," Rummins said. "Some nice carving on
it too."
 "Machine-carved," Mr Boggis answered superbly, bending down to examine th
e exquisite craftsmanship. "You can tell it a mile off. But still, I suppose
it's quite pretty in its way. It has its points."
 He began to saunter off, then he checked himself and turned slowly back a
gain. He placed the tip of one finger against the point of his chin, laid his
 head over to one side, and frowned as though deep in thought.<br><br>
 "You know what?" he said, looking at the commode, speaking so casually t
hat his voice kept trailing off. "I've just remembered...I've been wanting a
 set of legs something like that for a long time. I've got a rather curious
table in my own little home, one of those low things that people put in fron
t of the sofa, sort of a coffee-table, and last Michaelmas, when I moved hou
se, the foolish movers damaged the legs in the most shocking way. I'm very f
ond of that table. I always keep my big Bible on it, and all my sermon notes."
 He paused, stroking his chin with the finger. "Now I was just thinking.
These legs on your chestof-drawers might be very suitable. Yes, they might i
ndeed. They could easily be cut off and fixed on to my table."<br><br>
 He looked around and saw the three men standing absolutely still, watchin
g him suspiciously, three pairs of eyes, all different but equally mistrustin
g, small pig-eyes for Rummins, large slow eyes for Claud, and two odd eyes fo
r Bert, one of them very queer and boiled and misty pale, with a little black
 dot in the centre, like a fish eye on a plate.<br><br>
 Mr Boggis smiled and shook his head. "Come, come, what on earth am I s
aying? I'm talking as though I owned the piece myself. I do apologize."
 "What you mean to say is you'd like to buy it," Rummins said.
 "Well.... " Mr Boggis glanced back at the commode, frowning. "I'm not sure
. I might and then again...on second thoughts no...I think it might be a bit t
oo much trouble. It's not worth it. I'd better leave it."
 "How much were you thinking of offering?" Rummins asked.
 "Not much, I'm afraid. You see, this is not a genuine antique. It's merely
a reproduction."<br><br>
 "I'm not so sure about that," Rummins told him. "It's been in here over tw
enty years, and before that it was up at the Manor House. I bought it there my
self at auction when the old Squire died. You can't tell me that thing's new.,
, "It's not exactly new, but it's certainly not more than about sixty years ol
d."
 "It's more than that," Rummins said. "Bert, where's that bit of paper you
 once found at the back of one of them drawers? That old bill."
 The boy looked vacantly at his father.<br><br>
 Mr Boggis opened his mouth, then quickly shut it again without uttering
 a sound. He was beginning literally to shake with excitement, and to calm 
himself he walked over to the window and stared out at a plump brown hen pe
cking around for stray grains of corn in the yard.
 "It was in the back of that drawer underneath all them rabbit-snares," R
ummins was saying. "Go on and fetch it out and show it to the parson."
 When Bert went forward to the commode, Mr Boggis turned round again.
He couldn't stand not watching him. He saw him pull out one of the big mi
ddle drawers, and he noticed the beautiful way in which the drawer slid o
pen. He saw Bert's hand dipping inside and rummaging around among a lot o
f wires and strings.<br><br>
 "You mean this?" Bert lifted out a piece of folded yellowing paper and carr
ied it over to the father, who unfolded it and held it up close to his face.
 "You can't tell me this writing ain't bloody old," Rummins said, and
he held the paper out to Mr Boggis, whose whole arm was shaking as he too
k it. It was brittle and it cracked slightly between his fingers. The wri
ting was in a long sloping copperplate hand: Edward Montagu, Esq. Dr To T
hos. Chippendale A large mahogany Commode Table of exceeding fine wood, v
ery rich carvd, set upon fluted legs, two very neat shaped long drawers i
n the middle part and two ditto on each side, with rich chasd Brass Handl
es and Ornaments, the whole completely finished in the most exquisite tas
te £87 Mr Boggis was holding on to himself tight and fighting to suppress
 the excitement that was spinning round inside him and making him dizzy.
Oh God, it was wonderful! With the invoice, the value had climbed even hi
gher. What in heaven's name would it fetch now? Twelve thousand pounds? F
ourteen? Maybe fifteen or even twenty? Who knows?
 Oh, boy!<br><br>
 He tossed the paper contemptuously on to the table and said quietly, "It'
s exactly what I told you, a Victorian reproduction. This is simply the invoi
ce that the seller the man who made it and passed it off as an antique--gave
to his client. I've seen lots of them. You'll notice that he doesn't say he m
ade it himself. That would give the game away."
 "Say what you like," Rummins announced, "but that's an old piece of pape
r."
 "Of course it is, my dear friend. It's Victorian, late Victorian. About e
ighteen ninety. Sixty or seventy years old. I've seen hundreds of them. That
was a time when masses of cabinet-makers did nothing else but apply themselve
s to faking the fine furniture of the century before."<br><br>
 "Listen, Parson," Rummins said, pointing at him with a thick dirty finge
r, "I'm not saying as how you may not know a fair bit about this furniture b
usiness, but what I am saying is this: How on earth can you be so mighty sur
e it's a fake when you haven't even seen what it looks like underneath all t
hat paint?"
 "Come here," Mr Boggis said. "Come over here and I'll show you." He s
tood beside the commode and waited for them to gather round. "Now, anyone
 got a knife?"<br><br>
 Claud produced a horn-handled pocket knife, and Mr Boggis took it and
opened the smallest blade. Then, working with apparent casualness but actu
ally with extreme care, he began chipping off the white paint from a small
 area on the top of the commode. The paint flaked away cleanly from the ol
d hard varnish underneath, and when he had cleared away about three square
 inches, he stepped back and said, "Now, take a look at that!"
 It was beautiful--a warm little patch of mahogany, glowing like a topaz, r
ich and dark with the true colour of its two hundred years.
 "What's wrong with it?" Rummins asked.<br><br>
 "It's processed! Anyone can see that!"
 "How can you see it, Mister? You tell us."
 "Well, I must say that's a trifle difficult to explain. It's chiefly a mat
ter of experience. My experience tells me that without the slightest doubt thi
s wood has been processed with lime. That's what they use for mahogany, to giv
e it that dark aged colour. For oak, they use potash salts, and for walnut it'
s nitric acid, but for mahogany it's always lime."
 The three men moved a little closer to peer at the wood. There was a sli
ght stirring of interest among them now. It was always intriguing to hear ab
out some new form of crookery or deception.<br><br>
 "Look closely at the grain. You see that touch of orange in among the dar
k red-brown. That's the sign of lime."
 They leaned forward, their noses close to the wood, first Rummins, then
Claud, then Ben.
 "And then there's the patina," Mr Boggis continued.
 "The what?"
 He explained to them the meaning of this word as applied to furniture.
 "My dear friends, you've no idea the trouble these rascals will go to to
imitate the hard beautiful bronze-like appearance of genuine patina. It's ter
rible, really terrible, and it makes me quite sick to speak of it!" He was sp
itting each word sharply off the tip of the tongue and making a sour mouth to
 show his extreme distaste. The men waited, hoping for more secrets.
 "The time and trouble that some mortals will go to in order to deceive t
he innocent!" Mr Boggis cried. "It's perfectly disgusting! D'you know what t
hey did here, my friends? I can recognize it clearly. I can almost see them
doing it, the long, complicated ritual of rubbing the wood with linseed oil,
 coating it over with french polish that has been cunningly coloured, brushi
ng it down with pumice-stone and oil, bees-waxing it with a wax that contain
s dirt and dust, and finally giving it the heat treatment to crack the polis
h so that it looks like twohundred-year-old varnish! It really upsets me to
contemplate such knavery!"<br><br>
 The three men continued to gaze at the little patch of dark wood.
 "Feel it!" Mr Boggis ordered. "Put your fingers on it! There, how does it
feel, warm or cold?"
 "Feels cold," Rummins said.
 "Exactly, my friend! It happens to be a fact that faked patina is always co
ld to the touch. Real patina has a curiously warm feel to it."
 "This feels normal," Rummins said, ready to argue.
 "No, sir, it's cold. But of course it takes an experienced and sensitive f
inger-tip to pass a positive judgement. You couldn't really be expected to jud
ge this any more than I could be expected to judge the quality of your barley.
 Everything in life, my dear sir, is experience."<br><br>
 The men were staring at this queer moonfaced clergyman with the bulging
 eyes, not quite so suspiciously now because he did seem to know a bit abou
t his subject. But they were still a long way from trusting him.
 Mr Boggis bent down and pointed to one of the metal drawer-handles on
the commode. "This is another place where the fakers go to work," he said.
 "Old brass normally has a colour and character all of its own. Did you kn
ow that?"<br><br>
 They stared at him, hoping for still more secrets.
 "But the trouble is that they've become exceedingly skilled at matching it
. In fact it's almost impossible to tell the difference between "genuine old'
and "faked old'. I don't mind admitting that it has me guessing. So there's no
t really any point in our scraping the paint off these handles. We wouldn't be
 any the wiser."
 "How can you possibly make new brass look like old?" Claud said. "Brass
 doesn't rust, you know."
 "You are quite right, my friend. But these scoundrels have their own secr
et methods."
 "Such as what?" Claud asked. Any information of this nature was valuab
le, in his opinion. One never knew when it might come in handy.
 "All they have to do," Mr Boggis said, "is to place these handles overnig
ht in a box of mahogany shavings saturated in sal ammoniac. The sal ammoniac
turns the metal green, but if you rub off the green, you will find underneath
 it a fine soft silvery-warm lustre, a lustre identical to that which comes w
ith very old brass. Oh, it is so bestial, the things they do! With iron they
have another trick."<br><br>
 "What do they do with iron?" Claud asked, fascinated.
 "Iron's easy," Mr Boggis said. "Iron locks and plates and hinges are simp
ly buried in common salt and they come out all rusted and pitted in no time."
 "All right," Rummins said. "So you admit you can't tell about the handl
es. For all you know, they may be hundreds and hundreds of years old. Corre
ct?"
 "Ah," Mr Boggis whispered, fixing Rummins with two big bulging brown
eyes. "That's where you're wrong. Watch this."
 From his jacket pocket, he took out a small screwdriver. At the same tim
e, although none of them saw him do it, he also took out a little brass scre
w which he kept well hidden in the palm of his hand. Then he selected one of
 the screws in the commode--there were four to each handle--and began carefu
lly scraping all traces of white paint from its head. When he had done this,
 he started slowly to unscrew it.<br><br>
 "If this is a genuine old brass screw from the eighteenth century," he wa
s saying, "the spiral will be slightly uneven and you'll be able to see quite
 easily that it has been hand-cut with a file. But if this brasswork is faked
 from more recent times, Victorian or later, then obviously the screw will be
 of the same period. It will be a mass-produced, machine-made article. Anyone
 can recognize a machine-made screw. Well, we shall see."
 It was not difficult, as he put his hands over the old screw and drew it
out, for Mr Boggis to substitute the new one hidden in his palm. This was ano
ther little trick of his, and through the years it had proved a most rewardin
g one. The pockets of his clergyman's jacket were always stocked with a quant
ity of cheap brass screws of various sizes.<br><br>
 "There you are," he said, handing the modem screw to Rummins. "Take a l
ook at that. Notice the exact evenness of the spiral? See it? Of course you
 do. It's just a cheap common little screw you yourself could buy today in
any ironmonger's in the country."<br><br>
 The screw was handed round from the one to the other, each examining
it carefully. Even Rummins was impressed now.
 Mr Boggis put the screwdriver back in his pocket together with the fine
 hand-cut screw that he'd taken from the commode, and then he turned and wa
lked slowly past the three men towards the door.
 "My dear friends," he said, pausing at the entrance to the kitchen, "it wa
s so good of you to let me peep inside your little home--so kind. I do hope I
haven't been a terrible old bore."<br><br>
 Rummins glanced up from examining the screw. "You didn't tell us what y
ou were going to offer," he said.
 "Ah," Mr Boggis said. "That's quite right. I didn't, did I? Well, to tell you t
he honest truth, I think it's all a bit too much trouble. I think I'll leave it."
 "How much would you give?"
 "You mean that you really wish to part with it?"
 "I didn't say I wished to part with it. I asked you how much."
 Mr Boggis looked across at the commode, and he laid his head first to on
e side, then to the other, and he frowned, and pushed out his lips, and shru
gged his shoulders, and gave a little scornful wave of the hand as though to
 say the thing was hardly worth thinking about really, was it?
 "Shall we say...ten pounds. I think that Would be fair."<br><br>
 "Ten pounds!" Rummins cried. "Don't be so ridiculous, Parson, please!"
 "It's worth more'n that for firewood!" Claud said, disgusted.
 "Look here at the bill!" Rummins went on, stabbing that precious documen
t so fiercely with his dirty fore-finger that Mr Boggis became alarmed. "It
tells you exactly what it cost! Eightyseven pounds! And that's when it was n
ew. Now it's antique it's worth double!"<br><br>
 "If you'll pardon me, no, sir, it's not. It's a second-hand reproduction. But
 I'll tell you what, my friend--I'm being rather reckless, I can't help it--I'll
go up as high as fifteen pounds. How's that?"
 "Make it fifty," Rummins said.
 A delicious little quiver like needles ran all the way down the back of M
r Boggis's legs and then under the soles of his feet. He had it now. It was h
is. No question about that. But the habit of buying cheap, as cheap as it was
 humanly possible to buy, acquired by years of necessity and practice, was to
o strong in him now to permit him to give in so easily.
 "My dear man," he whispered softly, "I only want the legs. Possibly I could
find some use for the drawers later on, but the rest of it, the carcass itself,
as your friend so rightly said; it's firewood, that's all."
 "Make it thirty-five," Rummins said.<br><br>
 "I couldn't sir, I couldn't! It's not worth it. And I simply mustn't allow
myself to haggle like this about a price. It's all wrong. I'll make you one fin
al offer, and then I must go. Twenty pounds."
 "I'll take it," Rummins snapped. "It's yours."
 "Oh dear," Mr Boggis said, clasping his hands. "There I go again. I should
never have started this in the first place."
 "You can't back out now, Parson. A deal's a deal."
 "Yes, yes, I know."<br><br>
 "How're you going to take it?"
 "Well, let me see. Perhaps if I were to drive my car up into the yard, y
ou gentlemen would be kind enough to help me load it?"
 "In a car? This thing'll never go in a car! You'll need a truck for this!"
 "I don't think so. Anyway, we'll see. My car's on the road. I'll be back in
 a jiffy. We'll manage it somehow, I'm sure."<br><br>
 Mr Boggis walked out into the yard and through the gate and then down t
he long track that led across the field towards the road. He found himself
giggling quite uncontrollably, and there was a feeling inside him as though
 hundreds and hundreds of tiny bubbles were rising up from his stomach and
bursting merrily in the top of his head, like sparkling-water. All the butt
ercups in the field were suddenly turning into golden sovereigns, glistenin
g in the sunlight. The ground was littered with them, and he swung off the 
track on to the grass so that he could walk among them and tread on them an
d hear the little metallic tinkle they made as he kicked them around with h
is toes. He was finding it difficult to stop himself from breaking into a r
un. But clergymen never run; they walk Slowly. Walk slowly, Boggis. Keep ca
lm, Boggis.<br><br>
 There's no hurry now. The commode is yours! Yours for twenty pounds, a
nd it's worth fifteen or twenty thousand! The Boggis Commode! In ten minut
es it'll be loaded into your car--it'll go in easily and you'll be driving
 back to London and singing all the way! Mr Boggis driving the Boggis Comm
ode home in the Boggis car. Historic occasion. What wouldn't a newspaperma
n give to get a picture of that! Should he arrange it? Perhaps he should.
Wait and see. Oh, glorious day! Oh, lovely sunny summer day! Oh, glory be!
 Back in the farmhouse, Rummins was saying, "Fancy that old bastard givi
ng twenty pound for a load of junk like this."
 "You did very nicely, Mr Rummins," Claud told him. "You think he'll pa
y you?"<br><br>
 "We don't put it in the car till he do."
 "And what if it won't go in the car?" Claud asked. "You know what I thi
nk, Mr Rummins? You want my honest opinion? I think the bloody thing's too
big to go in the car. And then what happens? Then he's going to say to hell
 with it and just drive off without it and you'll never see him again. Nor
the money either. He didn't seem all that keen on having it, you know."
 Rummins paused to consider this new and rather alarming prospect.
 "How can a thing like that possibly go in a car?" Claud went on relentl
essly. "A parson never has a big car anyway. You ever seen a parson with a
big car, Mr Rummins?"<br><br>
 "Can't say I have."
 "Exactly! Arid now listen to me. I've got an idea. He told us, didn't he
, that it was only the legs he was wanting. Right? So all we've got to do is
 to cut "em off quick right here on the spot before he comes back, then it'l
l be sure to go in the car. All we're doing is saving him the trouble of cut
ting them off himself when he gets home. How about it, Mr Rummins?" Claud's
flat bovine face glimmered with a mawkish pride.<br><br>
 "It's not such a bad idea at that," Rummins said, looking at the commode.
"In fact it's a bloody good idea. Come on then, we'll have to hurry. You and B
ert carry it out into the yard. I'll get the saw. Take the drawers out first."
 Within a couple of minutes, Claud and Ben had carried the commode outsi
de and had laid it upside down in the yard amidst the chicken droppings and
 cow dung and mud. In the distance, half-way across the field, they could s
ee a small black figure striding along the path towards the road. They paus
ed to watch. There was something rather comical about the way in which this
 figure was conducting itself. Every now and again it would break into a tr
ot, then it did a kind of hop, skip, and jump, and once it seemed as though
 the sound of a cheerful song came rippling faintly to them from across the
 meadow.<br><br>
 "I reckon he's barmy," Claud said, and Bert grinned darkly, rolling his mi
sty eye slowly round in its socket.
 Rummins came waddling over from the shed, squat and froglike, carryin
g a long saw. Claud took the saw away from him and went to work.
 "Cut "em close," Rummins said. "Don't forget he's going to use "em on an
other table."<br><br>
 The mahogany was hard and very dry, and as Claud worked, a fine red du
st sprayed out from the edge of the saw and fell softly to the ground. One
 by one, the legs came off, and when they were all severed, Bert stooped d
own and arranged them carefully in a row.
 Claud stepped back to survey the results of his labour. There was a longis
h pause.<br><br>
 "Just let me ask you one question, Mr Rummins," he said slowly. "Even n
ow, could you put that enormous thing into the back of a car?"
 "Not unless it was a van."
 "Correct!" Claud cried. "And parsons don't have vans, you know. All they'
ve got usually is piddling little Morris Eights or Austin Sevens."
 "The legs is all he wants," Rummins said. "If the rest of it won't go in, th
en he can leave it. He can't complain. He's got the legs."
 "Now you know better'n that, Mr Rummins," Claud said patiently. "You kn
ow damn well he's going to start knocking the price if he don't get every s
ingle bit of this into the car. A parson's just as cunning as the rest of "
em when it comes to money, don't you make any mistake about that. Especiall
y this old boy. So why don't we give him his firewood now and be done with
it. Where d'you keep the axe?"<br><br>
 "I reckon that's fair enough," Rummins said. "Ben, go fetch the axe."
 Bert went into the shed and fetched a tall woodcutter's axe and gave it
 to Claud. Claud spat on the palms of his hands and rubbed them together. T
hen, with a long-armed high-swinging action, he began fiercely attacking th
e legless carcass of the commode.
 It was hard work, and it took several minutes before he had the whole thi
ng more or less smashed to pieces.
 "I'll tell you one thing," he said, straightening up, wiping his brow. "Th
at was a bloody good carpenter put this job together and I don't care what the
 parson says."
 "We're just in time!" Rummins called out. "Here he comes!"
